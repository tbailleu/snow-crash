for this level we have a suid binary own by the user flag13

$> ./level13
UID 2013 started us but we we expect 4242

after disassembling the binary we can see the problem
	if (getuid() != 4242) {
		printf("UID %d started us but we we expect %d\n", getuid(), 4242)
		exit(1);
	}
	token = ft_des("boe]!ai0FB@.:|L6l@A?>qJ}I");
	printf("your token is %s\n", token);

our uid here is 2013 and there isn't a user 4242
so we have multiple choise to bypass the Check

at first we can replace the getuid function via a dinamic library
but a most simple method is to do a static analize of the binary

we implemented the ft_des function from ASM in ft_des.c
so we can decode the token more easily

$> gcc ft_des.c && ./a.out
your token is 2A31L79asukciNyi8uppkEuSx

this token is the level14's password
