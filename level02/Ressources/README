for this level we have a packet capture file

after opening the file in wireshark we see a single TCP Stream

by folowing the stream we see a login attempt with password
	ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L

dot represent character 127 in ascii aka [delete key]

so the password use in login is
	ft_waNDReL0L

it's the flag02's password

$> su flag02
Password: _

$> getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : kooda2puivaav1idi4f57q8iq

this token is the level03's password
